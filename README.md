              repo: context.repo.repo,
              title: 'Browser Security Score Alert',
              body: `Security scan detected grade ${steps.scan.outputs.grade}. Please review the security posture.`
            })
```

## Security Tests Coverage

The scanner evaluates various security aspects including:

- **Browser Automation Detection**: Identifies automation tools and headless browser indicators
- **Memory Protection**: Tests for Spectre/Meltdown mitigations and memory safety features
- **API Security**: Evaluates security boundaries of Web APIs
- **Privacy Features**: Checks fingerprinting protection and tracking prevention
- **Network Security**: Tests TLS configuration and certificate validation
- **Content Security**: Evaluates XSS protection and content isolation
- **Extension Security**: Tests for malicious extension detection

For a complete list of tests, refer to the [BrowserTotal documentation](https://browsertotal.com).

## Requirements

- GitHub-hosted runners (ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, or macos-latest)
- For self-hosted runners:
  - Node.js 20 or higher
  - Playwright system dependencies

## Troubleshooting

### Browser Launch Issues

If you encounter browser launch failures:

1. Ensure you're using a supported runner OS
2. For headful mode, X11 display might be required on Linux
3. Check the error screenshot in the workflow artifacts

### Timeout Issues

If scans are timing out:

1. Increase the `timeout` parameter
2. Check if the BrowserTotal service is accessible
3. Review network connectivity from your runner

### Grade Threshold Failures

If your workflow fails due to grade thresholds:

1. Review the security summary in the workflow logs
2. Check the detailed JSON results for specific failing tests
3. Address identified security issues or adjust the threshold
